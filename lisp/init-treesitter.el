;;; init-treesitter.el --- Enable Treesitter-based major modes -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
;;; Commentary:
;;; Code:

;; You can download per-architecture pre-compiled release from
;; https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter/tree-sitter-langs Rename
;; contained grammars to add prefix "libtree-sitter-", place in
;; ~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter.
;;
;; Nix users can pre-install all grammars alongside their Emacs, see
;; https://github.com/nix-community/emacs-overlay/issues/341
;;
;; Note that grammar files from different sources can be differently
;; named and configured, so there could be different results. Some
;; common remappings are included below.
